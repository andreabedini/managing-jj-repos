# Jujutsu Troubleshooting

Solutions to common jj problems, error messages, and recovery scenarios. Invoke manually with `/jj-troubleshoot` or reference when encountering issues.

## Quick Diagnostics

Run these commands to gather information:
```bash
jj status              # Current state
jj log -n 10           # Recent history
jj op log -n 5         # Recent operations
jj bookmark list       # Bookmark status
```

## Common Error Messages

### "Bookmark is conflicted"
**Error:** `Refused to push a conflicted bookmark`

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. List bookmarks to see conflict
jj bookmark list       # Look for ?? marker

# 2. View commits involved
jj log

# 3. Move bookmark to correct commit
jj bookmark move main --to <correct-commit-id>

# 4. Push
jj git push --bookmark main
```

### "Divergent changes"
**Warning:** `Added working copy commit as ... (divergent)`

**Explanation:** Two visible commits share the same change ID (usually harmless).

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Squash to merge
jj squash -r <one-id> --into <other-id>

# Option 2: Abandon one
jj abandon <unwanted-id>

# Option 3: Continue working (often fine)
```

### "Stale working copy"
**Error:** `Working copy is stale`

**Solution:**
```bash
jj workspace update-stale
# or
jj status  # Triggers snapshot
```

### "Non-fast-forward push rejected"
**Error:** `Remote has moved forward`

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Fetch updates
jj git fetch

# 2. Rebase your changes
jj rebase -s <your-first-commit> -d main@origin

# 3. Push again
jj git push --bookmark main
```

## Common Problems

### Accidentally Undid After Push
**Problem:** Ran `jj undo` after `jj git push`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Redo (if just did undo)
jj redo

# Option 2: Re-push
jj git push --bookmark <name> --force

# Option 3: Fetch and reconcile
jj git fetch
jj bookmark move <name> --to <name>@origin
```

**Prevention:** Don't undo after push operations.

### Mixed Git and jj Commands
**Problem:** Used both tools, now state is weird

**Solution:**
```bash
# Import Git state to jj
jj git import

# Check for conflicts
jj bookmark list
jj log

# Resolve any conflicts
```

**Prevention:** Stick to one tool at a time.

### Can't Find Recent Changes
**Likely causes:**

1. **Not snapshotted:**
   ```bash
   jj status  # Triggers snapshot
   jj diff    # Now shows changes
   ```

2. **Looking at wrong commit:**
   ```bash
   jj log     # Find working copy (marked @)
   ```

3. **Changes were committed:**
   ```bash
   jj show @-  # Check parent
   ```

### Bookmark Not Moving
**Problem:** Making commits but bookmark stays on old commit

**Explanation:** This is expected! Bookmarks don't auto-advance in jj.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Move bookmark manually
jj bookmark move <name> --to @
```

**Better pattern:** Create bookmarks only when ready to push.

### Too Many Commits in Log
**Problem:** `jj log` shows overwhelming history

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Show only ancestors of working copy
jj log -r ::@

# Show last 10 commits
jj log -n 10

# Show commits between main and @
jj log -r main::@

# Configure default
jj config set --user revsets.log '::@ | @::'
```

### Lost Commits
**Problem:** Commits seem to have disappeared

**Solution using operation log:**
```bash
# 1. View operation history
jj op log

# 2. Find operation before commits disappeared
# 3. View repo at that operation
jj --at-op=<operation-id> log

# 4. Restore if commits are there
jj op restore <operation-id>

# 5. Or undo recent operations
jj undo
```

### File Deletion Not Tracked
**Problem:** Deleted files outside jj, not showing in diff

**Solution:**
```bash
jj status  # Triggers snapshot
jj diff    # Now shows deletion
```

**Prevention:** Run `jj status` after manual file operations.

## Conflict Resolution

### Identifying Conflicts
```bash
jj log     # Look for × marker
jj status  # May show "conflict" markers
```

### Understanding Conflict Markers
```
<<<<<<< Conflict 1 of 1
+++++++ Contents of side #1
changes from first parent
------- Contents of base
original content
+++++++ Contents of side #2
changes from second parent
>>>>>>> Conflict 1 of 1 ends
```

### Step-by-Step Resolution
```bash
# 1. Create working copy on conflict
jj new <conflicted-change-id>

# 2. Edit files to resolve (remove markers, keep desired content)

# 3. Review resolution
jj diff

# 4. Squash resolution into conflicted commit
jj squash

# 5. Verify conflict resolved
jj log  # × marker should be gone
```

### Alternative: Abandon and Redo
If conflict is too complex:
```bash
jj abandon <conflicted-change-id>
# Redo operation more carefully
```

## Recovery Scenarios

### Completely Lost - Start Over
```bash
# 1. Save current state
jj op log > ~/jj-op-log-backup.txt

# 2. Find good state
jj op log

# 3. Restore to known good operation
jj op restore <good-operation-id>
```

### Accidentally Force Pushed Wrong Thing
**If you have local operation log:**
```bash
# 1. Find operation before bad push
jj op log

# 2. Restore
jj op restore <operation-id>

# 3. Re-push correctly
jj git push --bookmark <name> --force
```
